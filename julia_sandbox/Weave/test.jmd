This a sample [Julia](http://julialang.org/) markdown document that can
be executed using [Weave.jl](https://github.com/mpastell/Weave.jl).

The documents will be written to the Julia working directory when you
use the `out_path = :pwd`.

## Capturing code

The basic code chunk will be run with default options and the code and
output will be captured.

```julia
a = 2
println("VARIABLE a = ",a)
```

You can also control the way the results are captured, plot size etc.
using chunk options. Here is an example of a chunk that behaves like a repl.

```{julia;term=true}
x = 1:10
d = Dict("Weave" => "testing")
y = [2, 4 ,8]
```
