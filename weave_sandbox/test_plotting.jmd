# Example with Plotting

## Capturing plots?
The basic code chunk will be run with default options and the code and
output will be captured.  Right now it is set to `eval=false` because there are issues with the capturing of plots

```{julia; eval=false}
using Plots
gr()
p = plot(1:10)
display(p)
```

## More stuff in a single cell
```{julia;term=false}
a = 5
b = 10
a + b
```
## More stuff emulating a REPL session
```{julia;term=true}
c = 5
d = 10
c + d
```
